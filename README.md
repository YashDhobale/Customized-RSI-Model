# Customized-RSI-Model

## The Excel file consists of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) Indicator Model to predict the RSI values of all the stocks in the Nifty 500 index

- The RSI Model has been constructed on a daily timeframe. The model gives users the flexibility to change the level of RSI right from 10 till 300. This level can be set in the B3 Cell of the Output sheet. After giving the input, the model automatically calculates the RSI values of all the Nifty 500 stocks & displays it on the screen. 

- The model will help traders keep a watch on the RSI values of all the stocks at one go. They can also get a broader view of the number of stocks within a particular RSI Range. Also they can keep a track of the stocks going below or above a particular RSI level & thus, eliminate the need of individually searching for stocks with a particular RSI value.

Note - This model only works on Excel 365 or higher versions.
